1: Identifying and Handling Private Attributes (Special Cases), Currently Found Private Attributes are:
    ResourceList: Handled
    v1.Time: Handled

2: Automation of struct_module_mapping and enum_module_mapping creation (enums) (Done for corev1, appsv1, rbacv1, metav1, schedulingv1)

3: Handling Unused Modules in the go-code generated: Partially Done By HardCoding

4: To check if converting from helm to yaml by helm-go client is feasible or not, since it will eliminate Helm as prerequiste for the script

5: Extending The Support For Enum-pointers (Example: PreemptionPolicy attribute in schedulingv1.PriorityClass)

---------- TMP Branch Text ---------------------
It should only come in new branch!
Object Oriented Design:
Global Variables and Variables that were getting passing from one fxn to another are made private attributes of struct
Attributes that can be set by user are made Public
Every Common Package File (except util.go), represents a struct (class) with its own methods
