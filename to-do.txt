1: Identifying and Handling Private Attributes (Special Cases), Currently Found Private Attributes are:
    ResourceList: Handled
    v1.Time: Handled

2: Automation of struct_module_mapping and enum_module_mapping creation (enums) (Done for corev1, appsv1, rbacv1, metav1, schedulingv1)

3: Handling Unused Modules in the go-code generated: Partially Done By HardCoding

4: To check if converting from helm to yaml by helm-go client is feasible or not, since it will eliminate Helm as prerequiste for the script

5: Extending The Support For Enum-pointers (Example: PreemptionPolicy attribute in schedulingv1.PriorityClass)
